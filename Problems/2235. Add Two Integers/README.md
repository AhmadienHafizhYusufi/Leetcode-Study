Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the `sum` of the two integers.

## Example 1:
### Input:
```c++
num1 = 12, num2 = 5
```
### Output:
```c++
17
```
### Explanation:
`num1` is 12, `num2` is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

## Example 2:
### Input:
```c++
num1 = -10, num2 = 4
```
### Output:
```c++
-6
```
### Explanation:
`num1 + num2 = -6`, so -6 is returned.

## Constraints:
-100 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ 100

## How To Solve
The sum is the total of the given numbers, in this case, `num1` and `num2`. Since there are only 2 parameters, you just need to return `num1 + num2`.
